<h1> First Normal Form (1NF) </h1>

<ul>
<li> 1NF helps us eliminate duplicate columns from a table and sets the stage for efficient data management. </li>

<li> In First Normal Form, we aim to ensure that each column contains atomic values—meaning they can't be divided further—and there are no repeating groups of data within a table. Columns should have unique names, and rows should be unique, often managed with a primary key. <br> 

let's say you're using a table called `Orders` to record every customer purchase. If each 'Item' field in your table can contain multiple Item IDs separated by commas for a single order, you're not in 1NF. The goal is to keep each value atomic—that is, singular and indivisible—so each entry in the 'Item' column should host only one Item ID.
</li>

<li> Splitting data into atomic values helps simplify queries and optimizes database performance. Doing this aligns the database with 1NF by making each entry atomic. </li>

<li> The concept of atomic values helps simplify database operations, making it easier to query, index, and update data. </li>

<li> When values are non-atomic, it complicates indexing and makes the database less efficient for querying. In 1NF, atomic values ensure that each piece of data is clearly identified and can be indexed optimally. </li>

</ul>

To summarize, First Normal Form ensures atomic values, unique names, no repeating groups, and unique rows. This is essential for efficient querying and database design.
