<h1> Event Sourcing </h1>

<p> Event Sourcing revolves around the idea of capturing every change to the system as an event. This allows you to reconstruct the system's state at any point in time by replaying the events. It's a powerful pattern that contributes to making systems more flexible and robust. <br>
t involves recording changes as a series of events rather than just storing the current state. This ensures that every change is preserved, which can be beneficial for auditing and tracing changes.  </p>

<p> Imagine a diary where you write every single thing you do each day. Event Sourcing is similar but for an application. It logs each change as an event, and you can replay these events to see how you reached the current state. </p>

<p> For Example - imagine an order process in an e-commerce system. Each step, like 'Order Placed' or 'Order Shipped', is recorded as an event. The current state of the order, like 'Order Received', can always be determined by replaying all these events. <br>
Instead of just storing 'Order Received', we record each event: 'Order Placed', 'Order Payment Complete', 'Order Shipped'. This log of events allows you to see the full history and recreate any point in time. </p>

<p> Event Sourcing provides numerous advantages including high traceability and the ability to recreate past states, which is beneficial for auditing. However, it does come with increased complexity and potentially higher storage usage compared to traditional approaches. </p>



<b>Advantages:</b>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced auditability with detailed event logs </li>
<li>Ability to replay events to reconstruct past states </li>
<li>Easier debugging and understanding of application changes </li>
<li>More flexibility in evolving the model and adding features </li>
</ul>

<b>Disadvantages: </b>
<ul>
<li>Increased complexity in managing and maintaining event logs </li>
<li>Potential for higher storage requirements over time </li>
<li>Requires careful design to handle event versioning and schema migration </li>
</ul>

<p> could you try explaining in your own words how Event Sourcing compares to the traditional approach?  <br>

In traditional approach - whenever a user do something, for example he updates his information, this change is persisted in the database. so now in the database we have the latest information, but we don't have past logs and we can not move back and forth in the database to get some past state. However in Event sourcing, this change is saved as an event along with all the past events (changes done in the past). so the current state can be retrieved by applying all the events from the beginning in chronological order. and in this approach we can also get some past state by running events only until that time.
